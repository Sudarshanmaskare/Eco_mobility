• Developed an Eco Mobility App for Android and iOS platforms using Flutter, integrating Google ML Kit for
Optical Character Recognition in an autonomous AI-powered ticket information extraction system.
• Utilized Here Maps Geo Encoding to convert place names into coordinates, and calculated optimal route distances via
Here Maps Routing API, and ensures ticket uniqueness by hashing and storing ticket images in the Firestore Database
achieving a 99% uniqueness validation rate. Implemented Firebase for storing user data encompassing Leafcoin details
and public transport distance traveled in the application.
